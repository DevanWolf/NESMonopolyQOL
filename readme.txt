NES Monopoly Quality of Life Patch
Made to fix issues and feature a 2008-style ruleset and look
Proudly ROM Hacked by Devan Wolf of Sobble Entertainment Inc.

Requires: Monopoly (U) [!]

Fixes:
Insufficient Rent/Luxury Tax Skip Exploit Workaround: don't check for control pad, only check for A/B/Start to return to board overview (EYOEEENY)
Correction: $200 from Vermont and Oriental Avenue have O instead of 0 (PANUOKPP+PANUXKPP+PEELSKPP+PEELVKPP)
Added missing pixels from Chance and GO tiles of board overview

International-based Changes:
Removed 10% option from Income Tax (now a flat $200)
Luxury Tax increased from $75 to $100 (IOOAVKZO)
Changed color group of Mediterranean and Baltic Avenue from Purple to Brown
Changed color of GO from Red to Black
Changed $ symbol to the Monopoly Dollar standard
Renamed "Parker Brothers Real Estate" to "Fast-Dealing Property"

A separate "skip legal screen" version is also available for those who hate that 4-second nag. Alternatively, use Game Genie code AAOZUOXY (Thanks Brad Corrupts).
